Word Guess is a language-learning game where you guess answers to TabooGPT's hints in a target language


To play Word Guess, each round a word will be selected for you to guess in a target language. TabooGPT will give you hints, synonyms, or examples to help you guess the word but you must avoid using the word itself. You may answer the word in the target language or your native language, and you can also ask clarifying questions to help understand the hints better. The game is designed to help you learn new words and improve your comprehension skills in the target language, while also having fun and challenging yourself.
